      <description>Is that Dependency Injection or Service Locator Pattern? I have to admit to something. For the last 2 years, I was using Service Locator Pattern in one of my projects while being completely convinced that I was using Dependency Injection, but it turns out that I&amp;rsquo;m not alone in making such a mistake. What are the differences, what are the consequences of being wrong, and how to distinguish these two patterns?</description>

      <description>About me Hello! My name is Tomasz Wąsiński. I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer from Poland with over 3 years of professional experience. I specialize as a backend engineer, systems architect and technical leader.
The first language which I reached the production environment with, was Python, and now I&amp;rsquo;m in love with it, although it&amp;rsquo;s not always easy.
I&amp;rsquo;m an enthusiast of DDD &amp;amp; clean architecture, and that&amp;rsquo;s how I prefer to build systems from the ground up.</description>
