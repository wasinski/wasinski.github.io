      <description>Timezone handling pitfalls - part 2 This time I will focus on issues that arise when multiple users have to coordinate to a particular time, but they still can be in different timezones.
Note that this is a continuation from the previous post which you can find here.
Let&amp;rsquo;s recall our example domain:
 we are dealing with task scheduling the user can schedule a task for an arbitrary day in the future, and when that day comes she can mark it as done our users travel a lot, so they do not stick to just one timezone, we would like to allow them to complete the tasks wherever they currently are  which led us to implement floating timezones as I like to call it - business logic dependent on the user&amp;rsquo;s local timezone, and storing the dates in the naive form (not timezone-aware).</description>

      <description>Is that Dependency Injection or Service Locator Pattern? I have to admit to something. For the last 2 years, I was using Service Locator Pattern in one of my projects while being completely convinced that I was using Dependency Injection, but it turns out that I&amp;rsquo;m not alone in making such a mistake. What are the differences, what are the consequences of being wrong, and how to distinguish these two patterns?</description>

      <description>Timezone handling pitfalls I Short intro of the domain Recently I have the pleasure to work as technology leader on a project that requires proper implementation of timezone handling, over some time I learned, sometimes the hard way quite a lot on this topic.
Let us introduce an example domain: task scheduling, the user can schedule a task for an arbitrary day in the future, and when that day comes she can marked it as done.</description>

      <description>About me Hello! My name is Tomasz Wąsiński. I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer from Poland with over 3 years of professional experience. I specialize as a backend engineer, systems architect and technical leader.
The first language which I reached the production environment with, was Python, and now I&amp;rsquo;m in love with it, although it&amp;rsquo;s not always easy.
I&amp;rsquo;m an enthusiast of DDD &amp;amp; clean architecture, and that&amp;rsquo;s how I prefer to build systems from the ground up.</description>
